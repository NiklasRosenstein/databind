  description: '`@implementation()` now sets the databind metadata field to `None`
    if no explicit metadata is already set on the type. `Registry.get_converter()`
    recognizes this case and stops checking the base classes. This is to avoid a confusing
    error when the type decorated with `@implementation()` seems to inherit the `UnionMetadata`
    from the parent class (because of the `Registry.get_converter()` base class check)
    but actually does not provide a metadata. Now we see "no converter found for type
    XYZ" instead "expected UnionMetadata to be provided by XYZ" in `databind.json`'
  fixes: []
