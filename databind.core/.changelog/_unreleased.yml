- type: feature
  component: general
  description: add `ImportingUnionResolver` and `EntrypointUnionResolver`, both which
    can also be used with the `@interface` decorator. The `resolver` argument now
    accepts a string which will be converted into a `UnionResolver` (supported formats
    are `import` and `entrypoint:<group-name>`)
  fixes: []
